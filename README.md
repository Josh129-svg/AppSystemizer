# AppSystemizer
This module converts user-installed apps to system apps (systemlessly thru magisk, without modifying your /system partition). Now comes with companion App Systemizer application written by [@loserskater](https://github.com/loserskater), which lets you pick any user-installed app to be converted to a system app. Install from Magisk Manager only, do not install from recovery.

## Supported Apps

* Action Launcher 3 (for Google Now integration)
* Nexus/Pixel C Launcher (for Google Now integration)
