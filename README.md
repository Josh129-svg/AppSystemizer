# AppSystemizer
This module converts user-installed apps to system apps (systemlessly thru magisk, without modifying your /system partition). Now comes with companion App Systemizer application written by [@loserskater](https://github.com/loserskater), which lets you pick any user-installed app to be converted to a system app (reboot is required after you select apps to be systemized). THIS MODULE CANNOT BE INSTALLED FROM RECOVERY! Install from Magisk Manager only. Check [Support thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=3477512) for additional information.

## Supported Apps
Only the launchers listed below are systemized by default. If you need to systemize any other user-installed apps, use the included companion AppSystemizer application written by [@loserskater](https://github.com/loserskater).
* Action Launcher 3 (for Google Now integration)
* Nexus/Pixel C Launcher (for Google Now integration)
